As already discussed, we partition the vector of variables into two blocks in order to take into account
the structure of the feasible set and possibly the form of the objective function (see, for instance,
the formulation of the risk parity problem, where the objective function is convex w.r.t. the scalar variable $\theta$).
The first block contains the constrained variables $x$, the second block contains
the unconstrained variables $y$. 

A first possibility can be that of defining a two-blocks Gauss-Seidel algorithm.
According to this scheme, at each iteration, the two component vectors $x$ and $y$ are
sequentially updated by performing  minimization steps (either exact or inexact) by  suitable descent techniques.
Globally convergent results of Gauss-Seidel algorithms (both exact and inexact) have been established in \cite{}, \cite{}, \cite{}.

We present here a block descent algorithm where a further level of decomposition is
introduced with respect to the block component $x$. 
More specifically, at each iteration, only two variables are updated, those corresponding
to a {\it Violating Pair}, by performing an inexact line search along a feasible and descent direction.
The adoption of a decomposition strategy with respect to the subvector $x$ is suitable
whenever the number $n$ of variables is large.

Note that the properties of the standard Armijo-type line search do not guarantee, without further assumptions
on the descent search direction $d^k$, that the distance between successive points tends to
zero, which is a usual requirement of decomposition methods. This motivates the employment
of the Quadratic Line Searck (QLS) defined in the appendix and based on the acceptance condition
$$
f((x^k,y^k)+\alpha^kd^k)\le f((x^k),y^k))-\gamma (\alpha^k)^2\|d^k\|^2.
$$
The algorithm is formally described below.
